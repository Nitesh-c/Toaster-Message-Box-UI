## Hello World !

### About This Project
This repo is a little experiment, a tidy, clean UI for displaying toaster messages. It's the result of moments when the creative side wins out over backend engineering ambitions.

### The Story
The goal is to become a Backend Engineer, but sometimes UI design becomes a distraction. There's a love for making a page more appealing and figuring out what makes a user experience feel special.

This specific project—the toaster UI—was built with:
- **HTML:** The backbone.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity.
- **Tailwind CSS:** To improve the look without extra effort.

### Tailwind
Tailwind is amazing. It feels like a superpower to build user interfaces. It's straightforward and makes designing a quicker and cleaner process. It's a big part of why this project was fun to build.
